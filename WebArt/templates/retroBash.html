<h3><u>What is Retro Bash</u></h3>
<div style="text-align: center">
    <p><b>This image is a retro like image with alternate versions of each character
    the left side has a more throwback and old timey kind of vibe while the right side
    provides a more robust and lively environment for the characters. Two parallel worlds
    in which they wear different clothes and different poses or expression </b></p>
</div>
<h3><u>What was the inspiration</u></h3>
<div style="text-align: center">
    <p><b> This image was partially inspired by the loud house show on nickelodeon
    because of the cartoony aspect of it, but I also was inspired by my mickey mouse figurine
    due to the fact that it was like a half and half figurine, half of the figurine is tug boat willy
    while the other half is modern mickey mouse. It was an intriguing figurine and I thought that it would be cool
    to try and remodel that. It also kind of just brings back childhood for me as well and is kind of makes me feel like
    a kid at heart once again, it was a great way for me to unwind and for me to just really be able to enjoy the kid side of
    me, allowing my imagination to really run wild and splatter against the canavs in a way that lets my childhood shine</b></p>
</div>
<h3><u>How Long did it take</u></h3>
<div style="text-align: center">
    <p><b>This image took about a month to create as I would have multiple instances of artist block.
    One thing about art for me is the fact that alot of times, the art work takes a while for me to really
    put together despite having and image of it in my head. For instance, the gloves were kind of hard to really put
    into action despite already having an image in my head about it</b></p>
